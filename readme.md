# Cursorzoo

## How to use 
```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cursorzoo@latest/cursorzoo.js"></script>
<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
        // OPTIONAL: setCursorZooImage(url);
        connectToWebSocket("ws://localhost:8080"); // YOUR SERVER HERE
    });
</script>
```
I created this for my own use, but feel free to use it.
May add more features in the future. ( like changing cursor size etc... )
